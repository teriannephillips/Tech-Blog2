## Description
Introducing a tech blog platform built with developers in mind. Our CMS-style site provides a space where developers can share their ideas, insights, and knowledge with the community. Our app follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm, ensuring a well-structured architecture. Using Handlebars.js as the templating language and Sequelize as the ORM, developers can easily create, edit, and publish their blog posts, while also commenting and engaging with other developers' content. With the express-session npm package, our app provides secure authentication to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all. Join our community and elevate your technical writing and communication skills with our platform.
